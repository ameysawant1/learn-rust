# 🦀 My Rust Learning Journey

Learning **Rust** — not just the syntax, but the philosophy: fearless concurrency, ownership, and systems-level safety.
## 🚀 Why Rust?

Coming from high-level languages, I wanted to understand how memory safety and zero-cost abstractions actually work. Rust forces you to think like the compiler — and that’s addictive.
## 📘 Progress

| Day | Topic | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|

| 01  | Hello Rust | Setting up cargo, first project |
| 02  | Ownership & Borrowing | Learned why the compiler is my best friend |

| 03  | Structs & Enums | Building data models with pattern matching |
| 04  | Lifetimes | Understanding references that don’t outlive their owners |

| 05+ | Async & Tokio | Coming soon... building a small TCP server |
## ⚙️ What I’m Building

- CLI tool to benchmark small Rust utilities  
- Async file watcher using Tokio  

- Tiny crate for JSON parsing experiments
